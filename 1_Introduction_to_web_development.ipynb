        "   - Every web-developer needs some basic set of tools for understanding the underlying structure of the code and enables us to inspect the web content. Developer tools are built directly into the browser. These are the tools that are browser dependent. Most of these tools are common among various browsers and do a range of things, from inspecting elements of a currently-loaded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. With developer tools, we can directly interact with the source code that is fetched into the client side of our system.\n",
